# First-Jupyter-Notebook
here I have tried some basic of python 
First of all I have uploaded the csv file in my jupyter notebook. For this I have checked my file location and working directory. I have located my file in the working directory and then
uploaded to the jupyter notebook .
For visualization , I have installed pandas_profiling. It is an excellent library  for profiling of the data and to visualize the overall condition of the dataset. I am really
amazed by this library
Finally I have done some basic data exploration by different mathematical operations 

ON the second part I have used google colab
